# Conception-d-insuline-artificiel
Projet M2R CCSC Ingénierie système
2020.12-2021.01

This projet aimed to design an touch screen for an intelligent artificial insulin meter that can detect the blood glucose index in real time and automatically inject insulin. The measured information is then transmitted to the mobile phone in real time via Bluetooth or remotely transmitted to the attending doctor via a transceiver;
-Established a high-level product framework with MagicDraw (Cameo), investigated the user's daily meal intake and different life scenarios, simulated the scenarios that users can choose and the conditions that the product must meet, and completed the black box analysis;
-Established information transfer diagrams between electronic machines for product activities and performance analysis, determined product structure to ensure that each component has a corresponding function, refined product functionality (e.g., each normal meal is based on the amount of insulin injected), and completed white box analysis;
-Performed product reliability analysis through FAT (Fault Tree Analysis), used AltaRica to model the product and then incorporated it to the error probability model;
Analyzed the component with the highest error rate of the model and its importance in the product, and proposed iterative optimization of the product's central control chip; 

- 该项目旨在设计一款拥有触摸显示屏，通过实时检测血糖指数自动注入胰岛素的智能人工胰岛素仪。 所测信息皆能通过蓝牙实时 传递给手机，或通过收发器远程数据传输给主治医生，使其能对病人状态实时监控。
- 使用 MagicDraw（Cameo）建立产品高层框架，通过预设不同产品使用场景扩展产品必须满足的条件，完成黑箱解析；
-  建立电子机械之间信息传递图，进行产品活动和性能分析。确定产品结构，完成白箱解析； 进行 FAT（Fault Tree Analysis）产品 可靠性分析，运用 AltaRica 将产品进行建模， 融入错误概率模型。 通过分析出错率提出迭代优化产品。
